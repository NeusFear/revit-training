## Getting to know the User Interface

Your screen should look something like this; Highlighted are the main sections of the Revit Interface and we will give them names so we are all on the same page.

- The Red Boxed area is called the "Ribbon"
- The Blue Boxed area is called the "Properties Palette"
- The Gree Boxed area is called the "Project Browser"

Browse through the different Ribbon tabs to familiarize yourself with where a lot of the buttons are.

##### Note: on each tab the buttons are in groups called "sections"

## Importing a CAD File

1. On the Ribbon click on the ``Insert`` tab.
2. In the ``Import`` section click on ``Import CAD``
3. From the dialogue box that pops up navigate to the file that you can download at the top of this page.
4. Make sure that before you click "Open" that your selections match this:
