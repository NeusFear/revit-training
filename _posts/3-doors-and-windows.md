In this lesson you will learn how to add doors and windows to your walls. You will also learn how to change the placement once inserted. Then you will learn how to change door window and height properties

## Getting Started

Make sure you have the source files downloaded for this exercise. You can get them with the links above.

## Place Exterior Doors

##### Doors are hosted elements, so to place hover over a wall and then left click when the preview lines up with where you want to place it.
##### If the door is swinging in the wrong direction you can press space bar to flip it before placement.

1. Open the Revit file: ``Lab01_E2_Adding Doors and Windows.rvt``
2. Open the ``Ground Floor`` view.
3. On the ``Architecture`` tab click on the ``Door`` button.
4. In the Properties Palette, select the door type ``Double-Glass 48" x 102"``.
5. Place the door at each location where the underlay is identified as ``Type A`` on the outer walls.
6. In the Properties Palette, select the door type ``Single-Glass 24" x 102"``.
5. Place the door at each location where the underlay is identified as ``Type B`` on the outer walls.

## Place Interior Doors

1. On the ``Architecture`` tab click on the ``Door`` button.
2. In the Properties Palette, select the door type ``Single-Flush 20" x 84"``.
3. Place the door at each location where the underlay is identified as ``Type A``.
4. In the Properties Palette, select the door type ``Single-Flush 24" x 84"``.
5. Place the door at each location where the underlay is identified as ``Type B``.
6. In the Properties Palette, select the door type ``Double-Flush 40" x 84"``.
7. Place the door at each location where the underlay is identified as ``Type C``.
10. Hit the ``esc`` key twice to exit the ``Door`` Command

## Place Exterior Windows

##### Windows are hosted elements, so to place hover over a wall and then left click when the preview lines up with where you want to place it.
##### Hovering your mouse around the outside of the wall will ensure that the window is facing in the correct direction.

1. On the ``Architecture`` tab click on the ``Window`` button.
2. In the Properties Palette, select the window type ``Casement with Trim 24" x 24"``.
3. Place the window at each location where the underlay is identified as ``Type A``.
4. In the Properties Palette, select the window type ``Casement with Trim 44" x 24"``.
5. Place the window at each location where the underlay is identified as ``Type B``.
6. In the Properties Palette, select the window type ``Casement with Trim 24" x 48"``.
7. Place the window at each location where the underlay is identified as ``Type C``.
8. In the Properties Palette, select the window type ``Casement with Trim 44" x 48"``.
9. Place the window at each location where the underlay is identified as ``Type D``.
10. Hit the ``esc`` key twice to exit the ``Window`` Command

## Change Window Head Height

1. Open the ``{3D}`` 3D View.
2. Notice that some of the windows that you just placed don't line up vertically with some of the existing windows. Let's look at the windows in the NE Corner of the model.
3. Select the two ``Type A`` windows by holding down the ``CTRL`` key and clicking on both of them.
4. In the properties palette, change the ``Head Height`` value to ``7' 0"``

5. Click ``Apply`` at the bottom of the properties palette to confirm the changes and you will see that these windows now line up!
6. Repeat steps 3 through 5 for window types ``B`` ``C`` and ``D`` separately to make all of them line up as well.
