In this lesson learn how to add new grid lines to existing curtain walls and edit existing grid lines and segments. Learn how to pin and unpin elements to prevent or allow changes to the layout

## Getting Started

Make sure you have the source files downloaded for this exercise. You can get them with the links above.

## Modify North Residence Curtain Wall

1. Open Revit file: ``Lab03_E2_Adjusting grid lines.rvt``
2. Open ``North Residence`` elevation view.
3. Our goal is to make the following layout from the current. See before/after below.

4. Select one of the grid lines. If you are having a hard time clicking on that grid line press the tab key until the line you want is highlighted.
5. Click on the ``Add/Remove Segments`` button in the ribbon.

11. Add a horizontal grid line in the center of the section highlighted below by clicking near the middle
12. Then click on the areas that we don't want grid lines in as shown below, they will then show as dotted.

13. Press enter to confirm
14. Repeat process using the same strategy until your grid system looks like this:
