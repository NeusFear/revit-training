In this lesson you will learn how to model interior and exterior walls by using an AutoCad drawing underlay as a guide.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have the source files downloaded for this exercise. You can get them with the links above.

## Create Exterior Walls

1. Open the Revit file: ``Lab01_E1_Modeling Exterior and Interior Walls.rvt``
2. Open the ``Ground Floor`` plan view on the left side of the screen
3. On the ``Architecture`` Tab, click the ``Wall`` button.
4. In the Properties Palette, select the wall type ``Generic 8"``.
5. Change the ``Location Line`` dropdown to read ``Finish Face: Exterior``
6. Trace the outer edge of the walls shown on the underlay drawing to complete the building's exterior walls


##### If the wall is being drawn on the wrong side you can press the space bar to flip it.

Once completed your building should look like this in the ``3D View (Roofs Hidden)`` View (new walls selected):
