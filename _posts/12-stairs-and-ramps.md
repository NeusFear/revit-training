In this lesson we will go over the basics of creating a stair by sketching run lines. We will lean to Flip a stair direction into place, Create stairs with multiple runs and complex layouts like L-shaped, U-shaped, and curved stairs. You will also learn how to create and modify ramps.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have the source files downloaded for this exercise. You can get them with the links above.

## Create a Straight Run Stair

1. Open Revit file: ``Lab04_E1_Creating Stair and Ramp.rvt``
2. Open the ``First Floor`` floor plan view. The Dashed red boundary inside the studio room is where the stair will be placed.
3. On the architecture tab click on the ``Stair`` button.

4. Set the ``Base Level`` to the ``First Floor`` and the ``Top Level`` to ``Second Floor`` in the properties palette.
5. Make sure the ``Actual Run Width`` is set to ``3' 0"`` and that you have the ``Straight`` draw mode chosen.

6. Draw the stair as shown below starting from the top of your screen to the bottom.

7. Press the green checkmark to confirm (as highlighted above)
8. Click on the stair and then use the arrow keys to nudge it into place as shown below.

9. Hit ``esc`` twice to exit the stair command

## Create an L-Shaped Ramp

1. In the same ``First Floor`` plan view we will be drawing a L-Shaped ramp in the other red dashed box.
2. On the architecture tab click on the ``Ramp`` tool.

3. Set the ``Base Level`` to ``First Floor`` and set the ``Base Offset`` to ``-1' 9"``.
4. Set the ``Top Level`` to ``First Floor``.
5. Confirm that the ramp ``Width`` is set to ``3' 0"``

6. Sketch the ramp by clicking on point 1, then move the mouse down ``15' 0"`` to mark 2. Then move the mouse cursor to approximately mark 3 and left-click then move the mouse until you have used up the whole length of the ramp. It should be around ``6' 0"``.

7. Click on the green checkmark to finish drawing the ramp. Don't worry about the ramp not being in the right place yet.
8. Move the ramp to it's final position against the concrete slab as shown.

9. Open the ``{3D}`` 3D view and see the ramp as shown.

10. Delete the railings.
11. Select the ramp and set the ``Top Offset`` to ``0' -3"`` to align it with the sidewalk better.
![moved](/lessons/12-stairs-and-ramps/moved.png)
12. Make the ramp solid by clicking on the ramp and in the properties palette click ``Edit Type``. Set ``Shape`` to ``Solid`` and click OK.
